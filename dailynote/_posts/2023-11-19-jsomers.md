> That’s the promise: you will live more curiously if you write. You will become a scientist, if not of the natural world than of whatever world you care about. More of that world will pop alive. You will see more when you look at it.

<!-- I want to make these 'bookmark' posts where I feature something else more often... maybe weekly? I'll explain the whole bookmark thing in a future daily note. -->

Fantastic, inspiring post. I've kept journals the whole year because of this, and I won't stop.

Writing, being able to format and output thoughts in your mind, is one of the most effective tools for better valuing and reflecting on each day that goes by.

> Writing needn’t be a formal enterprise to have this effect. You don’t have to write well. You don’t even have to “write,” exactly — you can just talk onto the page.

> Walk around with a pen and a scrap of paper. Write some meaty emails. Engage more intensely with this place.

I've been planning to write a blog post about my journaling habits, and this might push me to do it.
