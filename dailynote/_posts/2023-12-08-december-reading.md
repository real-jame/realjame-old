I've been reading a bit every day this month, so I'll be blogging each week about the books.
<!-- About the inactivity... I don't really have any reason. I simply have not wanted to work on anything in the last... 2 weeks, maybe? -->
<!-- But, I've fixed my sleep schedule, for good. And I get exercise daily now. -->
<!-- That, I think, is productive. I'm better in the long-term for it. -->
<!-- Is that an excuse? Well, I don't think anyone really cares either way if I work or not, this is just for my sake. -->
<!-- I regret not blogging either - I've had a few ideas for articles but never had the motivation to write them. -->
<!-- What will it take to break free of this cycle of not doing something, then coming up with an explanation for it and a plan to fix it, and nothing changes? -->
I'll say more in that week's article, but I try to find books I've never heard of and seem interesting when I'm at the library.

In other words, I'm not trying to *read* all of these books, but *explore* them. Even if you give up on a book, or simply skim it, you still gain something, I think.

I haven't actually read books in a few months now, and of course, I haven't read voraciously since I was 12 years old. If I build a habit now, I can change that for good. :^)

I'll post sometime soon, not sure when. Sunday? Then I can have 4 posts all in December, nice and tidy.
