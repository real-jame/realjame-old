I wanted to write another daily note. (I've been meaning to.)

I'm not dead. That's the most important thing! Now you know.

I don't have anything to show for any projects at the moment. That doesn't mean I haven't done anything or I've abandoned them; just that they aren't complete enough to present.

That's the reason there haven't been any blog/devlog posts. For the near future, I only want to share completed work and not just discuss what I'm dreaming of.

I hope you understand.
