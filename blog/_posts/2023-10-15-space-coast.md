On Saturday, September 14, I went to the [Space Coast Showdown](http://spacecoastshowdown.com/), an off-season robotics competition with my team.

I say "my" team, but I am new to the club. It was worth it to take the whole day off to be there and support everyone. I also learned a lot for how I can help contribute in the feature, as well as what competitions are truly like!

There was also a partial solar eclipse, which I didn't even know was happening. But when dozens of people started coming outside where we hanging out with the robot, peering into the sun with cardboard glasses that look like the old 3-D ones, there you go.

What a sight it was! It's something else entirely with such a simple lens - where the sun once was, now a perfectly crescent-shaped silhouette in orange. [Higher resolution video link](/blog/media/spacecoast-eclipse.mp4)

Anyways, about the competition, yeah. I didn't directly help much. But my teammates were very helpful, and it was nice meeting the majority of them for the first time. I mainly did just hang out and spectate, but I did help fetch a few things, as well as film the matches... that's gotta count for something, right?

Driving to and from the place was really something though. 2 hours one way... I've never driven that long before. And after doing so, I can say it was *fine*, but it was excruciatingly boring at times. Just having to devote full focus to essentially nothing but moving the wheel by fractions of an inch along a big road, **for hours**. I'll probably have to do it to see my family depending on the college I choose, so that'll be fun. Anyway, I listened to a fanmade radio drama called "Sonic and Tails R" to pass the time, it was pretty good!

I feel like I should be talking more about the reason I went to the competition - Robotics?! I mainly talked about the other minute details. I don't wanna say it was bad. There were a lot of periods of just waiting around doing nothing, but even then, it was fun! I got to talk to people, hang out, etc. All good. How about some more photos to wrap it up?

I was considering making this a daily note, but because of all the images and stuff, I might as well call it a blog post. Even if the writing feels like a daily note, but who really cares about categorizing? I am the only person on this planet who will care about how daily notes and blog posts are differentiated on realja.me. So why worry about it? :P
